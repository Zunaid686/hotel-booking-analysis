### Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.


Hotel bookings depend on many factors such as type of hotels, seasonality, days of week, meals available, parking spaces, charges etc. Hence analysing the patterns available in the past data is very important to help the hotels plan well accordingly in order to benefit the business.

The given data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces etc,

We tried to understand the customer’s’ behaviour and useful patterns in the data to help hotel managements improve the business by taking better decisions. The sequence of processes carried out to analyse the data is mentioned below:

### Data Cleaning and Data preparation:
●Data preprocessing is an important task. It is a data mining technique that transforms raw data into a more understandable, useful and efficient format.

•Data has a better idea. This idea will be cleared and understandable after performing data preprocessing. The data cleaning process detects and removes the errors and inconsistencies present in the data and improves its quality.

●Data quality problems occur due to misspellings during data entry, missing values or any other invalid data. Basically, “dirty” data is transformed into clean data. “Dirty” data does not produce the accurate and good results. Garbage data gives garbage out. So it becomes very important to handle this data. Professionals spend a lot of their time on this step.


### EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of visualizing and analyzing data to extract insights from it. In other words, EDA is the process of summarizing important characteristics of data in order to gain better understanding of the dataset.
